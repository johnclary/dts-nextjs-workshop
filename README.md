This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


## Getting Started

1. Install the app dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
4. If your app redirects to `/crashes`, you will need to clear your network cache or disable it with your dev console. To do so, open the dev console, go to the network settings tab, and disable the cache. Once you've done so, leave your console open and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` again.
